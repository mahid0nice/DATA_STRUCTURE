First slide:

        ~Data means raw facts that can be processed to get results.
        ~Some elementary items constitute a unit and that unit may be considered as a structure.
        ~A structure may be treates as a frame where we organize some elementary items in different ways.

        Data Structure : is a structure where we organize elemntary data items in  
                         different ways and there exits structural relationship among the items so that it can be used efficiently.

                        in other words, a data structure is means of structural relationships of elementary data
                        items for storing and retrieving data in computers memory.

        ~ususally elementary data items are the elements of a data structure.
        ~elementary data types:
                            #character
                            #integer
                            #floating point numbers etc.
        ~A data structure may be an element of another data structure.
                example: Array,Structure,Stack etc.
        ~We study data structures in two ways: 
                            #Basic : Having a concrete implementaition            
                                Example:       Variable,pointer,array etac.
                            #Abstract data types: ADTs are entities that are definition of data and operation but do not have any concrete implementation.
                                Example: List,stack,Queue etc.

        ~Basic: insertion( addition of a new elemennt in the data structure)
                deletion( removal of the element from the data structure)
                traversal( accessing data elements in the deata structure)
        ~Additional:  # searching(locating a certain element in the data structure)
                      # sorting(Arranging elements in a data structure in a specified order)
                      # merging(combining elements of two similar data structure)
        
        ~Algorithm is a set of instructions that can be followed to perform a task.
         In other wrods, sequence of steps that can be followed to solve a problem.

        ~Parts of Algorithm : three section:
            #first  section is input section, where we show which data elements 
                    are to be given or fed to the algirthm as an input.
            #second section is the most important one,which is operational or      
                    processing section. Here we have to do all necessary operations, such as computation, taking decision, calling other procedures etc.
            #third section is output, where we display or get the result with the 
                    help of the previous two sections.


Second Slide:
        ~An array can hold series of elements of the same type placed in  
            contiguous memory locations.
        ~In other words, arrays are a convenient way of grouping a lot of values
            of same type under a single varible name.
        ~The access for the two-dimensional array in that case is just as the  
            indexing of the array:
                [(total column)*(row index)+(column index)]
